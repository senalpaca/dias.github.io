## Overview

This case investigates the use of the Dialect Identification Assistance System (DIAS) in asylum procedures.  
It reconstructs the socio-technical infrastructure, the actors involved, and the implications for migrants' rights.

## Key Questions

1. How are borders and vocal identities (re)enforced through voice biometric technology?
2. How does the datafication of the voice in migration contexts reinforce algorithmic body politics?
3. What forms of harm, bias, and uncertainty are introduced by systems like DIAS?
