      <p class="about-intro">
        The DIAS Archive is an ongoing open-source investigation into the role of
        biometric voice technologies in European asylum systems. It examines how the
        Dialect Identification Assistance System (DIAS) influences borders,
        credibility evaluations, and the daily realities of people seeking protection.

          <p>
            We collect, analyse, and reconstruct how DIAS and related systems operate in
            practice. Our archive includes technical documentation, legal cases,
            testimonies, internal material, and research tracing how voice becomes
            evidence within asylum decision-making.

          <h2 class="about-section-title">Why DIAS matters</h2>
          <p>
            DIAS plays a subtle but critical role in defining credibility. Its assessments
            can influence the possibilities of refuge, determining who is believed and who
            is not. Understanding this system is essential for exposing its political,
            technological, and ethical implications.

          <h2 class="about-section-title">Our approach</h2>
          <p>
            This archive operates at the intersection of investigative research,
            critical algorithm studies, and digital forensics. It is guided by an
            abolitionist perspective: one that questions the logics of surveillance,
            categorization, and algorithmic border control.
